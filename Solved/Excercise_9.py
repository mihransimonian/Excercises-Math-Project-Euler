    A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which; a^2 + b^2 = c^2
        For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

    There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
    Find the product abc.


    Natural number: A whole number so no decimals etc, also no negatives

    Properties:
        An interesting fact: a Pythagorean Triple always consists of:
        - all even numbers, or
        - two odd numbers and an even number.

    A Pythagorean Triple can never be made up of all odd numbers or two even numbers and one odd number. This is true because:

    So, when both a and b are even, c is even too. Similarly when one of a and b is odd and the other is even, c has to be odd!

    Constructing Pythagorean Triples:
    When m and n are any two positive integers (m > n):
        a = m2 âˆ’ n2
        b = 2mn
        c = m2 + n2

    b = (2 * m * n)

    return (a, b, c)
